### Introduction
This project aims to create a robust hand gesture recognition model. The model is designed to accurately classify and identify different hand gestures from images or video data. This technology can be used in various applications, including gesture-based control systems and human-computer interaction.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [LeapGestRecog Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) from Kaggle. This dataset contains images of various hand gestures which are used to train and test the model.

### Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. **Download the dataset**:
    Ensure you have your Kaggle API token saved as `kaggle.json` in your working directory.

    ```python
    !mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
    !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
    !kaggle datasets download -d gti-upm/leapgestrecog
    ```

2. **Extract the dataset**:
    ```python
    import zipfile
    zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile('/content/leapgestrecog.zip', 'r')
    zip_ref.extractall('/content')
    zip_ref.close()
    ```

3. **Run the training script**:
    ```python
    python train_model.py
    ```

### Model Training
The model is built using deep learning techniques. The architecture and training process are defined in the `train_model.py` script. Ensure you configure the training parameters according to your requirements.

### Results
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set. The evaluation metrics and results are logged and can be reviewed for model improvements.
